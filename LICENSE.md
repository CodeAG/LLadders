A small number of textures incorporated into "Luppii's Ladders" are based on originals created by Mojang AB. Since these make up an insubstantial portion of Minecraft and are largely transformed in original ways, and are used only for the purpose of aesthetic compatibility, these are deemed a “fair use” under copyright law.
